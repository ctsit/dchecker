DChecker
========

*DChecker* is a tool for running data integrity queries for
[VIVO](http://www.vivoweb.org).

It scans a directory for SPARQL query files, runs each one sequentially, then
emails a report.


Quickstart
----------

    $ pip3 install git+https://github.com/ctsit/dchecker.git
    $ dchecker http://sparql.school.edu/ ./queries

*Note:* a report is printed to STDOUT and log messages are printed to STDERR.


Configuration
-------------

All configuration is done using command-line arguments. For more information,
look at the usage in `dchecker.py` or run:

    $ dchecker --help


Adding new queries
------------------

Queries are run sequentially from a specified folder (or the current folder
if unspecified).

To add a new SPARQL query, save it in the same folder as your other queries with
the `.rq` extension, and it will be included automatically when DChecker runs.
