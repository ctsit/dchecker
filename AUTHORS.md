DChecker was originally created in 2013 at the University of Florida by its
Clinical and Translational Science Informatics and Technology team.

A complete rewrite was done in 2019 for Python 3.

We greatly appreciate the contributors who have supported DChecker's
development, provided guidance and vision, and used DChecker in their daily
work.
